Below is an overview of the achievements of the OpenGov Lab in the first quarter of 2025.

<!-- more -->

1. **Woogle, information registry**
    * In 2024, [doubled in size again](https://wooverheid.nl/2024/12/29/woogle-in-2024-weer-verdubbeld/): now 3.4 million case files, over 4 million documents with 18 million pages.
    * In Q1, all laws from wetten.nl were added to Woogle (information category 1a), and the collection of Parliamentary Proceedings was extended in both chronological directions: with resolutions from the period 1576–1789, and the not-yet-finalized proceedings "from yesterday."
    * In Q2, we aim to make major progress with council meeting minutes from local governments via openraadsinformatie.nl.

2. **Free search system for every public authority**
    * Woogle has made [WooZM](https://wooverheid.nl/2025/01/17/woozm/), the *Woo Search Engine*, available. This allows any public authority to quickly create a version of Woogle with only their own documents and fully in their own visual identity, for use on their own web portal.

3. **WCAG, Woo documents accessible to the visually impaired**
    * This is a major OpenGov theme for 2025. The goals are 1) to raise awareness, and 2) to make software and workflows available that significantly improve accessibility.
    * In an [article in iBestuur](https://wooverheid.nl/2025/01/22/veel-beslisnotas-nog-niet-leesbaar-voor-blinden-en-slechtzienden/), we highlighted the issue and showed exactly how WCAG-accessible the decision memos of various ministries are. The results vary from very good to very poor—so it *is* possible to do better.
    * Research in Q1 [revealed a data leak in central government](https://wooverheid.nl/2025/04/18/onbedoelde-metadata-in-beslisnotas/) through unintended metadata in decision memos.

4. **Redaction detection**
    * OpenGov developed an effective method to detect [redacted text in PDFs](https://wooverheid.nl/2025/01/31/zwartlak-detectie-methode-gepubliceerd/). The method has just been published and is freely available at <https://lakdetector.wooverheid.nl>. When run in bulk, for example on all released Woo files from the past 10 years, it can reveal the amount of redacted content and highlight differences in redaction practices across public authorities.

5. **[ACOI report](https://wooverheid.nl/2025/02/21/woogle-acoi-rapport-over-woo-verzoeken/)**
    * A report for the [ACOI](https://acoi.nl/) on how easy it is for citizens to file a Woo request.

6. **["Schildpaddensoep"](https://wooverheid.nl/2025/03/18/rapport-schildpaddensoep-over-woo-doorlooptijden-is-uit/)**
    * A report on the processing times of Woo requests at ministries and local governments, created in collaboration with [Open State Foundation](https://openstate.eu/) and [IMI](https://www.imi.nu/).
