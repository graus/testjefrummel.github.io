## :material-clipboard-text-outline: Analysis and Findings

That is the main conclusion of the [:material-file-document: Schildpaddensoep Woo report](https://openstate.eu), released today, March 18, by the **Instituut Maatschappelijke Innovatie**, **Open State Foundation**, and the **University of Amsterdam**. The report analyzes:

- The Woo responses published by national and local governments in the past year
- For the first time: the dialogue between requesters and public bodies to refine requests — as intended by the Woo

> 📰 *"Faster response times are not impossible – local governments show it can be done differently."*
