# Zwartlak Detection Method Published

> "Redacted text: justified or not? This method helps find the answer."

In collaboration with the **Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations**, the **Rijksprogramma voor Duurzaam Digitale Informatiehuishouding (RDDI)**, and **TNO**, we developed a new method for detecting and analyzing redacted content in Woo documents.

![Example of redacted documents](https://wooverheid.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/screenshot-2025-01-31-at-9.55.54e280afam.png?w=966){ loading=lazy }

## :material-file-document-multiple-outline: What Does the Method Do?

This method helps public organizations:

- Automatically **analyze Woo decisions**
- **Identify redacted sections** in documents
- **Assess whether redactions were justified**, using an evaluation model

The method compares Woo decisions to their source documents, using text mining and data analysis to surface hidden information (without breaking legal boundaries).

!!! tip "Why This Matters"
    Transparency is a fundamental right. This method makes Woo processes verifiable, repeatable, and assessable â€” for governments and citizens alike.

## :material-github: Publication and Tooling

The method is freely available as open source, including:

- Documentation
- Examples
- Tools to get started
