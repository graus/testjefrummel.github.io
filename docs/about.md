The OpenGov Lab is dedicated to strengthening transparency, trust, and public participation by advancing how governments share and citizens access information. We do this by developing **AI, NLP, and information retrieval technologies** tailored to the complexities of open government data.

Our work addresses both the technical and social sides of this challenge, focusing on everything from smarter search to responsible publishing practices and inclusive design.

## :material-puzzle-outline: Work packages

The lab's research is structured around five interrelated **Work Packages (WPs)**. 
These packages span different perspectives in the open government data ecosystem:

- :material-domain: **Supply side** (governments as information providers)
- :material-account: **Demand side** (citizens, journalists, researchers)
- :material-scale-balance: **Information culture** (norms, practices, values)
- :material-folder-outline: **Passive publication** (e.g., via FOIA/Woo requests)
- :material-folder-open-outline: **Active publication** (e.g., proactive disclosure)

Below is a matrix showing how each work package aligns with both the type of publication and the stakeholder perspective:

|                           | :material-folder-outline: Passive publication        | :material-folder-open-outline: Active publication         |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **:material-domain: Supply side**       | :material-numeric-1-box-outline: | :material-numeric-2-box-outline: |
| **:material-account: Demand side**       | :material-numeric-3-box-outline: | :material-numeric-4-box-outline: |
| **:material-scale-balance: Information culture**| :material-numeric-5-box-outline: |                                  |

    The numbers in the table map to the following Work Packages:

    - :material-numeric-1-box-outline: + :material-numeric-2-box-outline: → [WP1](#wp1-publishing-fair-open-government-data)  
    - :material-numeric-3-box-outline: + :material-numeric-4-box-outline: → [WP2](#wp2-advanced-search-for-open-government-data), [WP3](#wp3-advanced-nlp-for-open-government-data)  
    - :material-numeric-5-box-outline: → [WP4](#wp4-toward-a-fair-information-culture-in-open-government), [WP5](#wp5-sources-and-evidence-in-open-government)


## WP1: Publishing FAIR Open Government Data  
:material-domain: Supply side &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :material-folder-outline: Passive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :material-folder-open-outline: Active

We investigate how governments can make their documents and data collections more **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)**, not just for humans, but also for machines. 
This work focuses on the **supply side** of open government data.

## WP2: Advanced Search for Open Government Data  
:material-account: Demand side &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :material-folder-outline: Passive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :material-folder-open-outline: Active

We design tools that help end-users such as citizens, journalists, and researchers to **find and navigate** complex government documents and datasets. 
This research focuses on the **demand side**, particularly in passive and active publication scenarios.

## WP3: Advanced NLP for Open Government Data  
:material-account: Demand side &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :material-folder-outline: Passive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :material-folder-open-outline: Active

Using cutting-edge **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, we study methods for **summarization, simplification, and conversational exploration** of government information. 
This enables better understanding and engagement with open government data. 

## WP4: Toward a FAIR Information Culture in Open Government  
:material-domain: Supply side &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :material-scale-balance: Information culture

We explore what it means to have a **FAIR information culture** in public institutions. 
This work bridges technology and society, and focuses on organizational practices and values that ensure information is usable by all.

## WP5: Sources and Evidence in Open Government  
:material-account: Demand side &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :material-scale-balance: Information culture

How can users trust what they read? This work examines the **authoritativeness and evidentiary value** of open government data, and how to make this clearer and more accountable in the government's information management practices.
