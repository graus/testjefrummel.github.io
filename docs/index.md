## Welcome to OpenGov.nl

Government transparency is central in a democratic society. Increasingly, governments at all levels are required to publish data — both proactively and passively (e.g., through FOIA/Woo requests).  

Our mission is to improve and support the interpretation, retrieval, and use of open government data, to increase transparency, public trust, and ultimately democratic participation. 
By collaborating with government, researchers, journalists, and citizens, we address the entire information lifecycle — from data creation and disclosure (supply) to its responsible use and societal impact (demand).

Our research helps improve information culture and practices within government, and empowers citizens to engage more effectively in public discourse and decision-making.

### :material-flask-outline: About the lab

The OpenGov Lab is an [Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence (ICAI)](https://icai.ai), and a collaboration between the [University of Amsterdam](https://uva.nl/en) and the [Rijksorganisatie voor Informatiehuishouding (RvIHH)](https://www.rvihh.nl/).

Our team currently consists of three dual PhD candidates employed at RvIHH, and plans to expand to five in its first year. 
Day-to-day operations are led by lab manager Dr. David Graus ([ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/)). Scientific co-directors are Dr. ir. Jaap Kamps ([ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/)) and Dr. Maarten Marx ([IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/)).
